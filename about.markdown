I am a MASc Candidate working on wearable devices for geriatric users and a member of the Human-Centred Robotics and Machine Intelligence (HCRMI) Lab at the University of Waterloo.

My research focus is to modify an existing lower-limb exoskeleton to be suitable for older adults and develop ways to improve human-exoskeleton interaction. In 2021, I developed a novel protocol for improving familiarity in interacting with lower-limb exoskeletons in able-bodied, first-time users, and currently am in the works of expanding this protocol to geriatric users and patients.

Research interests include wearable robotics, optimal control, assistive technologies, wearable robotics acceptance in elderly people, and human movement.
