# Hello there!
## Welcome to my website.

My name is Jan Lau and I am a MASc Candidate working on wearable devices for older adults at the University of Waterloo. My research focus is to modify an existing lower-limb exoskeleton to be suitable geriatric users and develop ways to improve interaction with this kind of device. In 2021, I developed a novel protocol for improving familiarity in interacting with lower-limb exoskeletons in able-bodied, first-time users, and currently am in the works of expanding this study to geriatric users and patients.
